Php framework
This project is a PHP framework made from scratch. It contains a routing functionality and a custom primitive di container.
For the database operations there is logic that uses the repository pattern. The business logic is divided into services and the web is MVC structure.
To demonstrate how it works I made a simple excercise on top of it so for the front end, I used a jquery data table with pagination, filtering, and ordering of the data which uses an ajax call.
The excercise is a very simple form in which the user enters a year, and the code takes that year and finds 30 prime years backwards from it, it display them and it displays on which day christmas is
(monday, tuesday, etc) for every year.
